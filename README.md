# Slag-DearImGui-backend #
Just a little library that enables use of [Slag](https://github.com/Joshua-A-Shelton/Slag) as a rendering backend for [Dear-ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

Including it in your project follows Dear-ImGui's philosophy. Just grab the two files (imgui_impl_slag.h/ imgui_impl_slag.cpp), and drop them into your project, no (extra) build system shenanigans (Slag itself still needs to be included, as well as the remaining Dear-ImGui files from that project). 

# License #
ZLIB license is included in the files themselves, which meets the criteria for using the files. No need to add any extra files anywhere :)
